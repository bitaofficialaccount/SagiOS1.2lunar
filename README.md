Introducing sagiOS: Your AI-Powered Online Operating System

sagiOS is a cutting-edge online operating system enhanced with advanced AI capabilities, designed to streamline your digital experience. Developed with user convenience and innovation in mind, sagiOS integrates a smart voice assistant that responds intelligently to your commands.

Getting Started with the Voice Assistant

To use the built-in voice assistant, you must provide a valid OpenAI API key. This key enables the assistant to process your requests with high accuracy.

How to get your OpenAI API key:

1. Visit OpenAI API Keys
2. Sign in or create an OpenAI account.
3. Generate a new API key.
4. Enter this key into sagiOS when prompted.

Without a real OpenAI API key, the voice assistant will not function.
